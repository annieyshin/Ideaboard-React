# Ideaboard App

An Ideaboard App, An React application built using Create React app, interacts with the [Ideaboard-Rails-API](https://github.com/sowmyadsl/Ideaboard-Rails-API) that I created.

The application responds to an API which has endpoints for creating, updating , editing and deleting ideas from ideaboard.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
